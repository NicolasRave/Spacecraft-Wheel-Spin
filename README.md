# Spacecraft-Wheel-Spin

-Searching for stabilizing spin rates of a wheel in a spacecraft which is to rotate about the intermediate axis of inertia. The wheel spin is chosen along this intermediate axis of inertia.

-Trying to investigate cases when a perturbation intervenes before the wheel rotation speed attains its commanded value.

The idea of this piece of rough-and-ready work came at the reading of a sub-chapter about dual-spin spacecraft in the chapter 4 of a relatively famous book, Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems, from Professors Schaub & Junkins. In this subchapter, to emphasize that "the spin rate is typically  held a constant value" seems to imply the avoidance of considering the period of spin rate increasing from 0 to a commanded value.
